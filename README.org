#+BEGIN_SRC
    pass checkup [pass-name]
        Check if a password is publicly leaked through HaveIbeenPwned's api.

        If no [pass-name] is supplied, we'll check all passwords.

        Lines of passwords that are leaked are outputed to STDERR while
        probably non-leaked passwords are outputted to STDOUT.

        So to get only leaked ones you can run:
        pass checkup [pass-name] > /dev/null

        Return codes for the extension is:
         - 0 if all passwords are fine or it's a helper / version subcommand
         - 1 if a specified pass-name doesn't exist
         - 2 if any of the pass-names checked is considered leaked

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC
    pass checkup [pass-name]
        Check if a password is publicly leaked through HaveIbeenPwned's api.

        If no [pass-name] is supplied, we'll check all passwords.

        Lines of passwords that are leaked are outputed to STDERR while
        probably non-leaked passwords are outputted to STDOUT.

        So to get only leaked ones you can run:
        pass checkup [pass-name] > /dev/null

    pass checkup [help|--help|-h]
        Print this help page.

    pass checkup --version
        Print version of this extension.
